# TyG Index and Glucose Prediction Calculator

## Project Overview

**Developed by Septerional**

**Research at Barceloneta Intelligence Complex.**
**By Agents: 1, 23, 31, 56, 89 & 90.**

A sophisticated Dart application for calculating the TyG (Triglycerides and Glucose) Index and predicting future glucose levels based on key metabolic parameters.

## Main Features

- TyG Index calculation
- Insulin resistance risk assessment
- One-hour glucose level prediction

## Scientific Foundations

### TyG Index

The TyG Index is a non-invasive method for estimating insulin resistance. Developed by researchers including:

1. Simental-Mendía, L. E., et al. (2008). "The product of fasting glucose and triglycerides as a surrogate for insulin resistance index." Metabolic Syndrome and Related Disorders, 6(4), 299-304.

2. Guerrero-Romero, F., et al. (2010). "The product of triglycerides and glucose as a diagnostic tool for insulin resistance in apparently healthy subjects." Metabolic Syndrome and Related Disorders, 8(6), 483-487.

#### Formula
TyG Index = log(Triglycerides / 2) + log(Glucose / 2)

### TyG Index Interpretation

- **Cutoff Point**: 4.5
- **> 4.5**: Potential high risk of insulin resistance
- **≤ 4.5**: Normal insulin resistance risk

## Glucose Prediction Methodology

The glucose prediction is based on:
- Current glucose level
- Carbohydrate consumption
- Insulin resistance index

- Basic knowledge of metabolism and glucose dynamics

## Usage

1. Run the program
2. Enter triglyceride levels
3. Enter fasting glucose levels
4. Enter current glucose level
5. Enter consumed carbohydrates
